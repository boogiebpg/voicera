# Voicera Rails Test Task

Using Rails 5.1.5 and Ruby 2.4.2

#### Instructions for running the app

Nothing special. DB is Sqlite, so just

1. `$ bundle install`   - install everything
2. `$ rails s`          - run server
3. `$ rake test`        - run tests

#### Estimated amount of time

4 hours

I was out of recommended 2-3 hours scope, so no bonus tasks.
